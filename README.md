# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for client who wants to crowdfund a playwright.
Throughout this Kickstarter Analysis, we did research for Louise who wants to know how to make her crowdfunding campaign successful. While looking at similar successful campaigns, the analysis using Excel will hopefully help her better understand how to fund her play "Fever." 

While working with the data set from different successful and unsuccessful fundraising campaigns, we are able to analyze that: 
- Based on Parent Category, theatre campaigns were most successful in the US. While looking at the subcategory of plays, more were successful than failed. See the picture of the bar graph below.

- Outcomes based on launch date showed that most successful Kickstarter campaigns were in the month of May. See image below.

- By seeing the data with successful and unsuccessful US Kickstarters for plays and analyzing the data with goal and pledged amounts, we know that the standard deviations are three times more than the IQR. This means that we can assume that most failed Kickstarters had really high goals that did not have enough funds pledged. 
- Lastly, looking at the box plot of Great Britain's musical campaigns, we can see the goal and pledged amounts. From the box and whisker plot graph, we can see that 4,000 euros will probably be too much to ask for her crowdfunding campaign. Instead, she would probably do better if the goal was around 2000 euros instead.
