# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
After fundraising for her play 'Fever,' Louise wants to know how different campaigns were successful using the information we have on crowdfunding different Kickstarters. Specifically, Louise wants us to look at the relationship between launch dates and funding goals. The purpose is to analyze different fundraising scenarios - specifically finding outcomes based on launch date start for theatres and outcomes based on monetary goals for plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After looking at the outcomes for theatre kickstarters to be successful based on their launch date, we see that May is the best time to launch a campaign. We can also assume that May (111 siccessful), June (100) and July (87) would also be great months to launch. On the other hand, we can also assume that in November (54) and December (37), launch dates were not as successful. Please see the chart below (Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We know that if the fundraising goal is met by the pledges and backers of a campaign, a campaign will more likely be successful. From the Kickstarter data, we were able to filter and determine the percentage of campaigns that were successful, failed or canceled based on their goal. From the data in the line graph below (Outcomes Based on Goal), we can see that the fundraisers with lower goals (< $1000 to $19,999) had higher percentage rates of being successful (>= 50% success rate). Likewise, we see that those who had higher goals had a higher perecentage rate of failing - specifically goals that were above $20,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
